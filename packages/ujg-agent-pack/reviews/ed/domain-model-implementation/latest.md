## Checklist

- Confirm source guidance still matches the current spec module definitions.
- Confirm cross-skill dependencies still route work to the right sibling skill.
- Update source skill text if the spec changed semantics, terms, constraints, or boundaries.
- Run `pnpm agent-pack:generate` to inspect generated skills under `build/`.
- Accept the review only after the source matches the current spec.
